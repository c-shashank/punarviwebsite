            <p>
              Punarvi began in a small home kitchen, where one woman with very sensitive skin started grinding herbs the way her
              grandmother once did. She was simply trying to make something gentle and honest enough for herself, using ingredients
              she could recognise and trust.
            </p>

            <p>
              After long workdays, she would come back to pots, powders, and handwritten notes. There were many failed batches, but
              she refused shortcuts—no ready-made bases, no synthetic fragrance “to make it nicer,” no chemicals she would not feel
              safe using on a child. When a friend’s rash calmed or a scar softened, it felt like a quiet blessing and a sign to keep
              going.
            </p>

            <p>
              Her husband watched this spark grow into something deeper. He offered his own skin and hair for every trial, stayed up
              late helping with labels and packaging, and took on the less glamorous work of sourcing and paperwork. Together, they
              decided that if they could not explain every ingredient on the label to their own daughter one day, it did not belong
              in a Punarvi jar.
            </p>

            <p>
              When their daughter was born, they chose to give the brand her name. For them, <strong>Punarvi</strong> is not a logo
              or a business plan; it is a promise to show up with the same care, patience, and honesty that they pour into raising
              her. Every product is still blended with that thought in mind: this must be safe and kind enough to live in our own
              home first, before it lives in yours.
            </p>

            <p>
              Today, Punarvi remains a small, family-led effort to keep Ayurveda simple, pure, and accessible. No big claims, no
              complicated routines—just powders made with love, clear intention, and herbs chosen as carefully as you would choose
              food for your family.
