              Long before there was a brand called <strong>Punarvi</strong>, there was a woman standing in a sunlit kitchen, grinding
              herbs the way her grandmother once did. She was the friend who always arrived with a little jar of something—an
              ubtan that calmed angry skin, an oil that soothed a tired scalp, a paste that smelled like temple flowers and monsoon
              earth. What began as care for her own sensitive skin slowly became a quiet obsession: to prove that Ayurveda, in its
              purest form, could still belong on our bathroom shelves.
            </p>

            <p>
              She held a demanding day job, but her evenings were for dalas and mortars, for scribbled notes and family recipes.
              Batch after batch, she refused shortcuts. No ready-made bases, no synthetic stabilisers, no “just a little” fragrance
              to make things smell more marketable. Each failure stung, but every small success—a rash that calmed, a scar that
              softened—felt like a blessing.
            </p>

            <div class="about-photo-placeholder">
              <!-- Placeholder: Add a photo of the founder here -->
              <span>Founder portrait placeholder</span>
            </div>

            <p>
              Through all of this, her husband watched her eyes light up in ways that spreadsheets never did. He was the first to
              offer his own hair and skin as test ground, the one who brewed her late-night chai when a batch split at 2 a.m. While
              she perfected ratios of manjistha and nalpamaradi, he read up on sourcing, packaging, and the quiet bureaucracy of
              building a business. When she doubted herself—“Who am I to bottle Ayurveda?”—he reminded her that intention mattered
              as much as knowledge, and that she carried both in abundance.
            </p>

            <p>
              Together, they travelled to small farms and co-operatives, choosing partners the way you choose family—slowly,
              carefully, with a lot of listening. They met women who still dried herbs on their terraces, men who refused to over
              harvest, families who believed the soil was borrowed from the next generation. With each handshake, the vision for
              their little brand grew clearer: if they couldn’t explain every ingredient on the label to their own child one day,
              it didn’t belong in the jar.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="about-story-aside">
            <div class="about-photo-placeholder tall">

            <p>
              The name <strong>Punarvi</strong> came the year their daughter was born. Looking at her, they felt the same fierce blend
              of tenderness and responsibility that they felt for their formulations. They wanted a name that held both rebirth and
              return—a return to ingredients you recognise, and a rebirth of how we think about beauty. Naming the brand after her
              was not a marketing choice; it was a quiet vow. If the jars carried her name, they had to be something she would be
              proud to inherit.
            </p>

            <p>
              In their home, new batches are still met with the same ritual. She opens the jars with the care of someone lifting a
              sleeping child. He checks the labels twice, making sure every word is honest, nothing overstated, nothing hidden.
              Together they test the textures on their own skin first—the under-eyes that have seen too many late nights, the hands
              that have packed countless orders, the foreheads that bear the weight of bills and dreams. Only when the products feel
              right to them as parents do they feel ready to send them out into the world.
            </p>

            <div class="about-photo-placeholder wide">
              <!-- Placeholder: Add a family photo / brand story image here -->

            <p>
              Punarvi is not a line built around trends or celebrity faces. It is a line built around evenings when the house is
              finally quiet, when they sit together and talk about which herbs soothed which customer, which formula needs more
              patience, which story from a stranger made them cry. Every review, every message from someone who finally found
              something gentle enough for their skin, is read aloud at the dinner table like a letter from an old friend.
            </p>

            <p>
              When you take a Punarvi jar into your home, you are not picking up a product that was developed in a boardroom. You
              are holding something that has been argued over lovingly, tested on the two people who created it, and blessed,
              silently, by a little girl whose name sits on the label. For this family, Punarvi will always be more than a brand—it
              is a living promise to show up with the same care, the same honesty, and the same heart that they pour into the child
              who inspired it.
